   - Derived from the Finnish word sisus, which refers to the internal organs (the guts), the ancient word sisu describes an attitude of bravery, resilience, stoicism, perseverance and determination in the face of adversity. It is a key psychological competence that enables extraordinary action to overcome a physically or mentally challenging situation. To have sisu confers a further dimension of doing so with honesty, integrity and humility.
