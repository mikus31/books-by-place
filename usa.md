- *Island Wisdom* is an inspirational and rewarding journey through traditional Hawaiian teachings that have stood the test of time, from how to be pono (live a balanced life) to how to mālama 'āina (preserve and protect the land). Filled with the voices and guidance of Hawaiian elders, regional folklore, and ancient teachings—plus gorgeous local photography and illustrations throughout—*Island Wisdom* is a celebration of Hawaiian culture, language, and values that will give you a deeper understanding, appreciation, and respect for Hawai'i and the Hawaiian way of life.

- [A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9791.A_Walk_in_the_Woods) by Bill Bryson (1998)
- The Appalachian Trail stretches from Georgia to Maine and covers some of the most breathtaking terrain in America—majestic mountains, silent forests, sparking lakes. If you’re going to take a hike, it’s probably the place to go. And Bill Bryson is surely the most entertaining guide you’ll find. He introduces us to the history and ecology of the trail and to some of the other hardy (or just foolhardy) folks he meets along the way—and a couple of bears. Already a classic, A Walk in the Woods will make you long for the great outdoors (or at least a comfortable chair to sit and read in).
